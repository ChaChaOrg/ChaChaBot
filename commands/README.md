#Commands
The commands that our bot recognizes and acts upon

## catch.js
```
Catch Rate Calculator. Variables in order:\n [Pokemon Name] [Max HP] [Current HP] [Catch Rate] [Pokeball Bonus] [Status Bonus] [Capture Power Bonus] [Player Catch Bonus] [Pokemon Level]
```
A pretty simple command (with a lot of args) that handles pokeball catching.
It doesn't do anything with the DB so you have to plug in all of the variables manually.
(might come back to this when/if we start storing PC data)
## damagelegacy.js
```
'Damage Calculator. Variables in order:
[Attacker (A) Name] [Defender (D) Name] [A\'s Level] [A\'s Attack Stat] [D\'s Defense Stat] [Dice Roll] [STAB] [Effectiveness] [Critical Hit] [Misc Modifiers] [Stages of Attack] [Stages of Defense]'
```
More or less deprecated - used when we have something bugged in neodamage.

The original command that inspired me to jump onto this project in a major way.
This command calculates pokemon move damage by taking in 11 required arguments and spits out the damage dealt.
We have taken this command and revamped it with neodamage to actually reference stored pokemon information.
## feat.js
```
Feat finder, prints a given feat name. +feat [feat name]
```

responds with the description of a feat given its name.
Not 100% up to date with ChaCha.

## genpoke.js
```
+genpoke [species] [level (1-20)] [nickname] [hidden ability % (as a number, 0-100)]
**FIELDS TO ADD LATER:**
 [trainerName] [private (optional: leave blank if public, put 1 if private]

Creates a new Pokemon when given the values above, printing it upon completion.
       
(Hint: You can view an existing Pokemon with '+showpoke [nickname]', or remove it using '+rempoke [nickname]'
```

Generates a fresh pokemon from just a name, species and level, everything else is randomized.

It waits for the pokemon to generate, then uploads the new pokemon to the DB.
Sends a generic pokemon Summary message in reply.
## genpokelegacy
```
New Pokemon Generator. Variables in order:
[Pokemon Name] [Level] [Base HP] [Base Atk] [Base Def] [Base SpA] [Base SpD] [Base Speed] [\% Male] [Number of Abilities Available (including hidden abilities)] [Size Bonus] [Hidden Ability % (optional)]
```
legacy genpoke
Generates a pokemon but every single stat and field is defined
used when network stuff is wonky as a last resort.

## gentrainer.js
```
Generates a random trainer. For Arceus Only!

+gentrainer [TrainerType (no spaces)] [# of feats (up to 4)] [min trainer level] [max trainer level] [# of pokemon] [min poke level] [max poke level] [pokeoption1] [pokeoption2] ...

To list types: +gentrainer types
To get a random trainer name/ttype: +gentrainer random
```
A DM side tool that gens a trainer.

## importpoke.js
```
'Pokemon importer. Paste showdown export string or fill in as follows.
Note that you can omit individual EVs or the entire EV line if they all equal 0.
Replace any instances of [] with the desired Pokemon's info (without the brackets themselves), and make sure that each piece of info is on its own line.
            +importpoke [Nickname] ([Species]) ([M/F/N])
            Ability: [Ability Name]
            Level: [Level]
            EVs: [#] HP / [#] Atk / [#] Def / [#] SpA / [#] SpD / [#] Spe
            [Nature] Nature
            IVs: [#] HP / [#] Atk / [#] Def / [#] SpA / [#] SpD / [#] Spe
```
Allows you to import a specific pokemon based off of a Showdown import string.
Ith then uploads this pokemon to the SQL serv.
## listpoke.js
```
Lists all Pokemon you can see.

You can view these in more comprehensive detail at the **ChaCha Database Site:** http://34.226.119.6:7000/
```
 Sends you a DM with every pokemon you can see. Has a basic private/public var on each pokemon and will let you know if a pokemon is yours or not.
sorts by entry date as of right now.
## modpoke.js
```
+modpoke [nickname] [fieldToChange] [newValue]`

Modifies an existing Pokemon in the database. 
Use `+modpoke list` to view all available changeable fields.)
```
 Lets you modify a pokemon entry in the DB. Because some Pok√©mon values rely on each other, we check if its one of those then handle accordingly.

For example, if you change a pokemon's level this should let you know which stats change and modify the entry accordingly. 

Also allows you to confirm or reject a change with a reaction interface.

Pokemon HP is handled wonky in ChaCha in comparison with other stats so health is rerolled and handled incorrectly as of right now.
## movetutorlegacy.js
```
The command to check the Train Pokemon DC to learn a new move.

+movetutor [PokeName] [MoveName (with no spaces plz)] [MovePP] [Successes(0-5)]

To learn a skill: +movetutor [PokeName] [IntMod] Skill [SkillName]

To get evo bonuses: +movetutor evolution
```
ChaCha has a system of DC's for learning moves, and this takes in input and tells you the DC accordingly.
There are plans to have a movesystem handle some of this.

## damage.js
```
Damage Calculator. Variables in order:
 [Attacker (A) Name] [Attacker Move] [Defender (D) Name] [Stages of Attack] [Stages of Defense] [Extra Base Power] [MultDamage (min 1)] [Critical Hit (y/n)]
```
a command that calculates the damage of an attack given two pokemon and a few necessary fields. Will soon be moved to just be 'damagelegacy.js'.

First scans the DB for each pokemon named and stores each in a pokemon object. This makes sure we grab all the necessary stats, and is made really easy by the pokemon object.

Then once the pokemon are done loading, we grab the move data from our api, then the move's type info to line up effectiveness.

We load in various stages in atk/def ups/down, scan for type effectiveness, roll critical hits, and then roll damage dice.

Finally we run the damage calculation then post the embed!

## ranger.js
```
Pokemon Ranger Catch/Loop command. Variables in order:
 +ranger [Pokemon Name] [Pokemon Dex Mod] [Catch Rate]
```
A quick ranger loop DC calc.
## reload.js
a command reload command that we theoretically could use to update code while the bot is running but for right now its much easier to just restart it.

## rempoke.js
```
+rempoke [nickname]

Deletes the listed Pokemon from the SQL database, if it exists.

((If found, confirm deletion by reaction to the posted message.))
```
A command the deletes a pokemon that you own.
Has a reaction confirmation message.

## showpoke.js
((Oh oops this one doesn't have a help message))

Given a name, posts its pokemon's summary message.
