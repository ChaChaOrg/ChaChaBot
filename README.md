# ChaChaBot
ChaCha bot is a discord bot used as a companion for [Chambers and Charizards][1] an RPG based on Pokemon created by Philip Zendels

This bot's purpose is to be a tool to smooth out a DM's workload when working with dozen's of seperate pokemon and minimize the juggling of numbers wherever we can.

We are also developing a [companion website][2] that should also help enhance and streamline the ChaCha experience.
